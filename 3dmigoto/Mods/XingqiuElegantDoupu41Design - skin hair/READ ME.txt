Several people were involved in the making of this mod, even though some things had to be scrapped and restarted again. 
The people involved in the final version were:
- Anilyan: For doing the initial model and textures, then also doing a better job at both at the end
- Shuffleo: For putting the original version of the model together
- Polymer: For joining the textures and preparing an initial lightmap
- Mecchi/mimo4e: For doing the weights
Other people whose attempts at weighting ended up scrapped but did their best were Fuyukai, Shuffleo and Skittey
