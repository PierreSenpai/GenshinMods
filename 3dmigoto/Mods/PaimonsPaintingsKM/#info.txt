Change emojis...
 1. Browse the PNG folder to see them all
 2. Edit "emojis.ini" to change the numbers
    (Keep them as .dds - no need to use .png!)

Better way to change emojis and keep the changes...
 1. Make a copy of the emojis file and rename it to @swap
 2. Delete everything in it except for "namespace = paimon"
    and the characters you plan to change the emojis of
 3. Carry the @swap file with you between versions
✧ Keep the @ symbol, as that allows it to load first

4th Anniversary...
 - To switch to the anniversary emojis, rename "DISABLED4th" to "4th"

Etc...
 - Emoji files with ~ aren't from the Paimon's Paintings sets
 - Disable emojis for profile avatars by deleting "profile.ini"
 - Reload mods when Genshin is open by pressing F10 (by default)
