Change emojis...
 1. Browse the PNG folder to see them all
 2. Edit "emojis.ini" to change the numbers
    (Keep them as .dds - no need to use .png!)

Etc...
 - Emoji files with ~ aren't from the Paimon's Paintings sets
 - Disable emojis for profile avatars by deleting "profile.ini"
 - Reload mods when Genshin is open by pressing F10 (by default)

4th Anniversary...
 - To switch to the anniversary emojis, rename "DISABLED4th" to "4th"

To view .DDS images, download the image viewer Irfanview and install the plugins from the same page: (https://www.irfanview.com/64bit.htm) Because the images are upside down (I don't get it either), you'll need to press V in Irfanview to flip them. Press T when viewing an image to view all images in that folder as thumbnails.

To edit .DDS images, download Paint.net: https://www.getpaint.net

To batch process images, try chaiNNer: https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer
